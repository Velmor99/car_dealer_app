# Car Dealer Application

ðŸš— Car Dealer App is a Next.js application that allows users to filter car models by make and year, displaying the results dynamically. Visit the live site [here](https://car-dealer-1sick2iin-velmor99s-projects.vercel.app).

Here is a link to production versel site

## Features

- **Vehicle Search**: Filter car models by make and production year.
- **Dynamic Dropdowns**:
  - Dynamically load vehicle makes and years.
- **Pre-rendered Pages**: Optimize performance with pre-rendered result pages using `generateStaticParams`.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a seamless experience across devices.
- **Navigation**: Intuitive navigation with a "Next" button to view search results.

## Technical Highlights

- **Pre-rendering Paths**:
  - The application pre-renders specific routes for result pages using `generateStaticParams`. This approach ensures fast load times and improves SEO.
- **Dynamic Select Components**:
  - The `SelectComponent` is highly reusable and supports dynamic data fetching. The vehicle makes and model years are fetched and displayed dynamically based on the userâ€™s selection.
