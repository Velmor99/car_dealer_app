# Car Dealer Application

Welcome to the **Car Dealer Application**! This application allows users to search for car models by selecting a vehicle make and a production year. The application is built with **Next.js** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a modern, responsive, and interactive user experience.

## Features

- **Vehicle Search**: Filter car models by make and production year.
- **Dynamic Dropdowns**:
  - Dynamically load vehicle makes and years.
- **Pre-rendered Pages**: Optimize performance with pre-rendered result pages using `generateStaticParams`.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a seamless experience across devices.
- **Navigation**: Intuitive navigation with a "Next" button to view search results.

## Technical Highlights

- **Pre-rendering Paths**:
  - The application pre-renders specific routes for result pages using `generateStaticParams`. This approach ensures fast load times and improves SEO.
  
- **Dynamic Select Components**:
  - The `SelectComponent` is highly reusable and supports dynamic data fetching. The vehicle makes and model years are fetched and displayed dynamically based on the user’s selection.
